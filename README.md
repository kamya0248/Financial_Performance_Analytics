# Financial Performance & Profitability Analytics

Power Query | Power Pivot | P&L Modeling | Gross Margin Analysis

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes multi-year financial performance (FY 2019–2021) for a global consumer electronics hardware company. The objective was to build a structured Business Intelligence solution to evaluate revenue growth, cost expansion, and profitability trends across markets and sub-zones.

Using Power Query for ETL and Power Pivot for data modeling, a scalable P&L analytics framework was developed to provide executive-level financial visibility.

---

## Business Problem

While the company experienced significant revenue growth, leadership required deeper insights into:

* Whether revenue growth translated into margin growth
* If COGS expansion was compressing profitability
* Which markets were most profitable
* How Gross Margin % evolved over time
* Quarterly stability of financial performance

The goal was to move beyond topline growth and assess true profitability health.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query (ETL & Data Transformation)
* Power Pivot (Data Modeling)
* DAX Measures
* Multi-year YoY Analysis
* KPI Benchmarking

This project was built using a structured BI workflow with relational modeling rather than basic spreadsheet calculations.

---

## Data Engineering Approach

Using Power Query:

* Imported and structured financial datasets
* Standardized fiscal year formatting (Sep–Aug cycle)
* Cleaned and prepared monthly and yearly aggregations
* Built structured tables for modeling

---

## Data Modeling

A relational model was created in Power Pivot enabling:

* Multi-year comparison (2019–2021)
* Monthly to quarterly aggregation
* Market and sub-zone filtering
* Dynamic Gross Margin % calculations

DAX measures were developed for:

* Year-over-Year Sales Growth
* YoY Gross Margin Growth
* GM% calculation
* Sales comparison (21 vs 20, 20 vs 19)

This enabled flexible financial slicing and executive reporting.

## Dashboard & Analysis Modules

### 1. P&L by Fiscal Year

* Net Sales
* COGS
* Gross Margin
* GM%
* YoY comparison metrics

### 2. P&L by Month

* Monthly Net Sales and COGS
* Quarterly grouping
* GM% trend tracking

### 3. Market-Level P&L

* Revenue by country
* Market-level Gross Margin
* Profitability comparison

### 4. GM% by Sub-Zone

* Quarterly GM% comparison
* Margin stability analysis

---

## Key Insights

* Net Sales grew significantly across fiscal years.
* COGS growth increased at a comparable rate, reducing margin efficiency.
* Gross Margin % declined over time despite absolute profit growth.
* High-revenue markets do not always generate the highest margins.
* Margin performance varies across sub-zones, indicating cost or pricing differences.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

* Conduct cost structure optimization to protect margin percentage.
* Prioritize high-margin markets in expansion strategy.
* Implement quarterly margin monitoring dashboards.
* Establish margin thresholds for early risk detection.
* Align pricing strategy with regional profitability patterns.

---

## Business Impact (Simulated)

If implemented effectively, this framework can enable:

* Improved margin stability
* Better cost control visibility
* Data-driven pricing decisions
* Enhanced executive financial reporting
